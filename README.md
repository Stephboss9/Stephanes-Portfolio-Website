# My new portfolio website
My 2024 new and updated personal/portfolio website. 
Welcome! I created this website to re-familiarize myself and practice with React.js/TypeScript (web development) after a fun but long and arduous fall semester of school.
I plan on updating this website over time. Check back from time to time. You might see something cool. ‚ù§
